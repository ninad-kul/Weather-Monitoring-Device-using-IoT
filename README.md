# Weather-Monitoring-Device-using-IoT
This project deals with Weather monitoring using Sensors and Microcontroller.

Our aim in this project was to measure weather related parameters like Temperature, Humidity and Pressure and show the results on a web server of ESP8266.

Components - 
1. Microcontroller - ESP8266 (wifi module)
2. Sensors -

    a. DHT 11 -- Temperature and humidity sensor
   
    b. GP2Y1010AU0F -- Dust density sensor
   
4. Prototyping PCB and connecting wires
